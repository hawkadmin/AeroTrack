# Expo Counter App

A minimal React Native app built with Expo and TypeScript featuring a single screen with a button and a counter.

## Run locally

- Install dependencies (already installed if you used the scaffold step):

```bash
npm install
```

- Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Then choose one of:
- `npm run android` to open on Android emulator/device
- `npm run ios` to open on iOS simulator (macOS only)
- `npm run web` to run in the browser

## What it does

- Displays the current count
- Tapping the "Increment" button increases the counter by 1
